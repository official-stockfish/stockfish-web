Whether you are a programming wizard or just a fan, there's something you can do to help make Stockfish even better.

## Fishtest

Fishtest lets you volunteer your computer's processing power to help
test future versions of Stockfish. No coding required! All you need to
do is install the Fishtest worker, and your computer will automatically
start playing chess games using future and current versions of the
engine.

- [Install Fishtest worker](https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Running-the-worker)
- [Fishtest Dashboard](http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests)

## Write Code

Do you have a great idea that could improve Stockfish's playing
strength? Fork the project on GitHub and commit away. Then use Fishtest
to test your change.
