Today, we have the pleasure to announce Stockfish 16.1. As always, you can **freely** download it at [stockfishchess.org/download](<https://stockfishchess.org/download>) and use it in the [GUI of your choice](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Download-and-usage#download-a-chess-gui>).

Don't forget to join our [Discord server](<https://discord.gg/GWDRS3kU6R>) to get in touch with the community of developers and users of the project!
## Quality of chess play

In our testing against its predecessor, Stockfish 16.1 shows a notable improvement in performance, with an [**Elo gain** of up to **27 points** and **winning over 2 times more game pairs**](<https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/65d666051d8e83c78bfddbd8>) than it loses.
## Update highlights

### Improved evaluation

- **Updated neural network architecture**: The neural network architecture has undergone two updates and is currently in its [8th version](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md#sfnnv8-architecture>).
- **Removal of handcrafted evaluation** (HCE): This release marks the removal of the traditional handcrafted evaluation and the transition to a **[fully neural network-based approach](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/af110e0>)**.
- **Dual NNUE**: For the first time, Stockfish includes a [secondary neural network](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/584d9ef>), used to quickly evaluate positions that are easily decided.

### UCI Options removed

`Use NNUE` and [`UCI_AnalyseMode`](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/c53d2ec>) have been removed as they no longer had any effect. [`SlowMover`](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commit/536d692>) has also been removed in favor of `Move Overhead`.

### More binaries

We now offer 13 new binaries. These new binaries include `avx512`, `vnni256`, `vnni512`, `m1-apple-silicon`, and `armv8-dotprod`, which take advantage of specific CPU instructions for **improved performance**.  
For most users, using `sse41-popcnt` (formerly `modern`), `avx2`, or `bmi2` should be enough, but if your CPU supports these new instructions, feel free to try them!

### Development changes

- **Updated testing book**: This [new book](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/books/commit/426eca4>), now derived exclusively from the [open Lichess database](<https://database.lichess.org/>), is **10 times larger** than its predecessor, and has been used to test potential improvements to Stockfish over the past few months.
- **Consolidation of repositories**: Aiming to simplify access to our resources, we have moved most Stockfish-related repositories into the official [Stockfish organization](<https://github.com/official-stockfish/>) on GitHub.
- **Growing maintainer team**: We welcome [Disservin](<https://github.com/Disservin>) to the team of maintainers of the project! This extra pair of hands will ensure the lasting success of Stockfish.
