Stockfish 8 is out!

This is the result of the effort of many people along many months: it
has been a huge and hard effort and I would like to thank all the
testers for their relentless patience, determination and creativity. I
would like to thank all the people supporting us with CPU time (we don't
ask nor accept donations so if you want to support us then donating CPU
time through [fishtest](http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests) is the
way to go and we greatly appreciate that). I would like to thank Kiran
Panditrao for the super fast binaries provided in record time and Daylen
Yang for the amazingly fast update of the site: you guys are great!

Stockfish 8 is the same version that will go for the TCEC superfinal, it
will be exactly the same, so what else should I say? Just fingers
crossed for TCEC and have fun you all with this new Stockfish 8.
