This is Stockfish 3.

The big news of this version, and the reason why we have bumped version
number to 3 is not due to ELO increase (that anyhow should be
interesting) nor to some cool feature, but it is due to the new super
awesome testing framework that Gary setup and currently runs on

<http://tests.stockfishchess.org/>

This is really a new beginning for Stockfish development. A development
that now is fully open and in just few weeks has already attract many
people willing to test their ideas and some of their contributions have
been already committed upstream: Lucas Braesch, Ryan Schmitt,
Jean-Francois Romang, James Undery, Hiraoka Takuya, jhellis, Joona
Kiisky (a great return!) and of course Gary Linscott.

As a technical note for people willing to compile themselves, this time
you will find also the C++11 porting along the usual C++ sources. This
is 100% fully functional equivalent of the std version, but on some
platforms and with some compilers (like gcc 4.8) the C++11 binary may be
even faster, but it's up to you to try and to verify on your preferred
platform :-)

A special thank to Jim for his always precious support in compiling the
release version and to Daylen, our stockfishchess.org webmaster that
silently and without fanfare has built a really beautiful site and a
fully operational support service.

Have fun
